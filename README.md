# Short Text Location Prediction
Program written and developed in the language Python as the final project for the subject COMP30027: Machine Learning at the University of Melbourne - Semester 1, 2019.

### Goal: 
To build and critically analyse some supervised Machine Learning methods, with the aim of automatically identifying the location from which a textual message was sent, as one of four Australian cities. Although this is a simplification of the more general problem of **geotagging**, it is still a very difficult problem, which has been well-studied, but a solution remains elusive.

This aims to reinforce the largely theoretical concepts surrounding learners, data representation, and evaluation, by applying them to a sophisticated problem.
