# Short Text Location Prediction
Program written and developed in the language Python as the final project for the subject COMP30027: Machine Learning at the University of Melbourne - Semester 1, 2019.

### Goal: 
To build and critically analyse some supervised Machine Learning methods, with the aim of automatically identifying the location from which a textual message was sent, as one of four Australian cities. Although this is a simplification of the more general problem of **geotagging**, it is still a very difficult problem, which has been well-studied, but a solution remains elusive.

This aims to reinforce the largely theoretical concepts surrounding learners, data representation, and evaluation, by applying them to a sophisticated problem.

### Datasets:
The data has collected from Twitter (https://www.twitter.com), specifically for this Project. According to Twitterâ€™s Terms of Service, this data cannot share for any other purpose, or reproduce it in any form, other than as isolated examples.
Please note that the dataset is a sample of actual data posted to the World Wide Web. As such, it may contain information that is in poor taste, or that could be construed as offensive. 
The opinions expressed within the data are those of the (anonymised) authors, and in no way express the official views of the University of Melbourne or any of its employees; using the data in an educative capacity does not consitute endorsement of the content contained therein.

With that in mind, the following samples are how the data looks like:
